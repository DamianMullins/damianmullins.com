It's been a busy few weeks for me, at work and at home, so no real progress has been made on the Coinsly app. I did, however, manage to do a bit of reading, and watch a course, on various React related subjects.

## What have I been reading?

Here is a quick breakdown of what I have been reading by category.

### General

- [How to NOT React: Common Anti-Patterns and Gotchas in React](https://codeburst.io/how-to-not-react-common-anti-patterns-and-gotchas-in-react-40141fe0dcd)
- [How to Structure Your React Project](https://daveceddia.com/react-project-structure/)
- [Lean React Project With Parcel](https://medium.com/dailyjs/lean-react-project-with-parcel-a6ffe0fac0d2)
- [An imperative guide to forms in React](https://blog.logrocket.com/an-imperative-guide-to-forms-in-react-927d9670170a)
- [React v16.3.0: New lifecycles and context API](https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/03/29/react-v-16-3.html)

### Patterns

I'm interested in learning different patterns which can be put to use in React. I was particularly interested in learning more about render props.

- [Function as Child Components](https://medium.com/merrickchristensen/function-as-child-components-5f3920a9ace9)
- [Compose Render Props](https://blog.kentcdodds.com/compose-render-props-46cf491e9d19)
- [React.js in patterns](http://krasimirtsonev.com/blog/article/react-js-in-design-patterns)

### State

Trying to get an idea of best practices and how best to manage application state, it seems like every blog post I read on this subject has a warning to not add Redux to your project too early. I'd like to find out about other ways to manage state early on in a project.

- [Application State Management](https://blog.kentcdodds.com/application-state-management-66de608ccb24)
- [Using a function in `setState` instead of an object](https://medium.com/@wisecobbler/using-a-function-in-setstate-instead-of-an-object-1f5cfd6e55d1)
- [Thinking Statefully](https://daveceddia.com/thinking-statefully/)

### Redux

I know I've written a paragraph above about finding out other ways to manage state, but I still wanted to do a bit of reading up on Redux just so I have a good idea of what it is, how it is useful, and at what point (if any) it is recommended to start adding it to a project.

- [What Does Redux Do? (and when should you use it?)](https://daveceddia.com/what-does-redux-do/)
- [What is a Redux reducer?](https://daveceddia.com/what-is-a-reducer/)
- [Where and When to Fetch Data With Redux](https://daveceddia.com/where-fetch-data-redux/)

### Context API

The newly updated context API in React seems to be a pretty popular topic in the dev community right now, I wanted to read up on it to find out more and to see if it was something I could use in the Coinsly app.

- [React's ‚öõÔ∏è new Context API](https://medium.com/dailyjs/reacts-%EF%B8%8F-new-context-api-70c9fe01596b)
- [ReactJS Docs: Context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html)

### CSS in JS

Another topic I don't know much about. I've always been quite strict on how I write CSS so I very rarely have issues with specificity or ‚Äúleaking‚Äù styles. I'd like to know what other benefits it brings to the table.

- [CSS in React](https://alligator.io/react/react-css/)
- [How does CSS fit into Reactjs?](https://hackernoon.com/how-does-css-fit-into-react-5a4aa4840135)
- [CSS in the Age of React: How We Traded the Cascade for Consistency](https://engineeringblog.yelp.com/2018/03/css-in-the-age-of-react.html)
