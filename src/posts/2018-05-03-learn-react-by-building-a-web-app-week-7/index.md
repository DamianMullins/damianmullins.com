It has been a busy two weeks of reading, listening to podcasts, and watching talks online. I did manage to make a few updates and bug fixes to Coinsly which I've [listed below](#changes-to-the-coinsly-app).

## Podcasts

I had some time whilst travelling to London recently which gave me time to catch up on a few podcasts I've wanted to listen to.

## Changes to the Coinsly app

A very quick run-through of the changes I've made.

- Updated package dependencies to latest versions.
- Fixed firestore warning by passing a `timestampsInSnapshots: true` setting.
- After first signing in an error was being thrown because the filters prop in the `Filters` component is `null` when created. To fix this I provided a default value of an empty array.
- Fixed issue with totals component where `NaN` was being displayed on initial load because the default values in state are set to `0` which causes a divide by zero exception when working out the percentages.
- Refactored `coinHelper` to use a new filter method, and to prevent multiple copies of objects being made.

You can [check out the code on the GitHub repo](https://github.com/DamianMullins/Coinsly/tree/35b64c58e6384c5aa6da8a0c3a4da11d41e01a96), or view and run it in the CodeSandox window below.
