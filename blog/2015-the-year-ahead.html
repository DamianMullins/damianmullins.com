        </p>
        
        <p>Last year was full of change, I got engaged(!), refocused on client side development, worked in an (proper) agile scrum team for the first time, attended my first meetup, architected a custom adaptive framework using SCSS, and finally, left my job at the very end of the year to chase new challenges.</p>
<p>This year I&#39;ve joined JustEat as a software engineer which involves heavy use of API&#39;s and internationalisation, whilst striving for high availability and scalability; all areas I am keen to learn more about. I&#39;m excited to be working for such a large technology driven company with an awesome culture, and loads of experienced engineers to learn from. Plus my podcast obesession has increased thanks to the extra commute time!</p>
<p>This means my focus is moving back to the server side again, but I plan to keep a healthy mix of both client &amp; server side.</p>
<p>Because so much has been changing recently I wanted to write down a few things to focus on over the next 12 months. </p>
<h2 id="tech">Tech</h2>
<p>A lot of my time is spent reading about web frameworks and languages, but I rarely take the time to dive in and try them out in any depth. That will change this year. </p>
<p>My first target this year will be EcmaScript 6 which I feel that I&#39;ve put off for long enough. This will be followed by Angular or possibly <a href="http://aurelia.io/">Rob Eisenberg&#39;s new framework Aurelia</a> which looks very interesting.</p>
<p>As a result of this my plan is to record my experiences here and hopefully have a few projects up on GitHub.</p>
<h2 id="books">Books</h2>
<p>I&#39;m aiming to read one book a month. No more, no less, I don&#39;t want to stretch myself or be unrealisitic. If it&#39;s a technical book and I feel the urge, I&#39;ll put some code up on <a href="http://github.com/DJMelonz">my GitHub profile</a>, and write a review here.</p>
<p>These are my books of choice, in no particular order</p>
<ul>
<li>Git in practice</li>
<li>Release it!</li>
<li>JavaScript application design</li>
<li>Secrets of the JavaScript ninja</li>
<li>The responsive web</li>
<li>Soft skills</li>
<li>Head first design patterns</li>
<li>Dependency injection in .Net</li>
<li>C# in depth</li>
<li>Seven Languages in Seven Weeks (envisage this being a 2 month read)</li>
<li>ReWork: Change the Way You Work Forever</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the benefits of working for JustEat is a free subscription to <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/">Safari</a> which means I have access to most of the books in the list.</p>
<h2 id="blog">Blog</h2>
<p>I&#39;m not going to make any crazy commitments such as posting here every week, but I&#39;m planning on writing about anything I find really interesting instead of keeping it all in my head. Hopefully I can look back at these posts for future reference, and who knows maybe somebody else will find them useful. </p>
<p>Good luck future me!</p>
